    <!-- WHAT WE DO SECTION -->
    <section class="wedo-section-container">
      <h1>What we do</h1>
      <p>
        We are a nonprofit open source software cooperative whose mission is to
        develop robust and secure digital infrastructure. We strive to enable
        more people to reliably run their own infrastructure by producing
        correct, surprise-free software to be deployed in real environments. Our
        software aims to meet the needs of anyone working in an environment
        where security and dependability is vital. We write all our code in a
        high-level memory-safe (and more secure) programming language called
        OCaml. In addition each piece of software leverages MirageOS (a minimal
        operating system) to produce bespoke applications tailored to only
        contain their required functionality. Each service is executed on
        virtual machines with a size usually around 1-10 MB, much smaller than a
        UNIX / Linux system, and it boots within milliseconds. Where other
        approaches try to patch general purpose operating systems by adding more
        layers, we strive to build a secure system from the ground up. Our
        approach means our software has a number of security and ease-of-use
        benefits: each application is small and fast to start our software can
        be run on all major hypervisors and is ready for the cloud we are able
        to provide rapid prototyping with a seamless path from prototype to
        production reduced attack vectors, for example by guarding against
        things like memory corruption a small code base which means a smaller
        attack surface, and easier review and audit the complexity is reduced
        ensuring ease of use and helping people to understand the technology it
        is possible to formally verify important parts with a proof assistant
        (proof writing software) We work with clients, partners and funders to
        design and develop open-source protocols and applications within this
        approach. If you are interested in seeing how we can assist you in
        improving your organization's digital infrastructure please see our
        services offered. If you like our approach to open source software and
        want to support our work please consider a donation. Or if you are a
        funder of open source projects focused on security and reliability and
        like our approach we would love to hear from you.

        <h3>Hannes</h3>
        <p>
          Hannes enjoys living in Berlin, Germany. Until end of 2017, he used to
          be a research associate at the University of Cambridge in the rems
          project. He enjoys to write code, and also traveling and repairing his
          recumbent bicycle, and being a barista. Hannes did his PhD in computer
          science about formal verification of imperative code (using a
          higher-order separation logic and the theorem prover Coq). Hannes
          co-authored not-quite-so-broken TLS, a TLS implementation from the
          ground up in OCaml, and contributes to the MirageOS project as a core
          team member. He is working on various projects, including opam signing
          and netsem, an executable formal model of TCP/IP which can act as a
          test validator. His blog is at https://hannes.robur.coop.

        <h3>Reynir</h3>
        <p>
          Reynir goes foraging, sniffing and picking interesting plants found in
          nature, cycling with one, two or more wheels, and knits now and then.
          Based in Århus, Denmark he goes winterbathing in the cold sea. Reynir
          studied computer science at Aarhus University with an interest in
          programming languages and formal verification. After some years
          working in industry with heterogenous unix systems followed by two
          years of various volunteer work he joined Robur in 2020. He is still
          heavily involved as a developer and system administrator in data.coop,
          an association that collectively owns and run servers offering digital
          services for their members.

        <p>
          Dinosaure wants the majority of its services to be unikernels in
          OCaml. A big reader of RFCs, it implements protocols and formats in
          OCaml. He has been participating in MirageOS for quite some time and
          continues to promote its use and develop usable unikernels such as
          paste.osau.re, bob, and his blog.
